Problem 1-1

The ONLY thing we are interested in when designing programs is that it returns 
the correct answer.

False correct


Problem 1-2

When determining asymptotic complexity, we discard all terms except for the one 
with the largest growth rate.

True correct


Problem 1-3

Bisection search is an example of linear time complexity

False correct


Problem 1-4

For large values of n, an algorithm that takes 20000n^2 steps has better time 
complexity (takes less time) than one that takes 0.001n^5 steps

True correct
